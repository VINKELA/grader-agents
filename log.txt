Raw scores for Content, Organization, Word Choice, Sentence Fluency, Conventions, and Feedback were collected into `gradedData/grader_agent.csv`. Average scores for each evaluation category were calculated manually due to a tool error, and results were compiled into `gradedData/grades.csv`.

- `gradedData/grader_agent.csv` includes detailed individual scores from each grader with feedback.
- `gradedData/grades.csv` contains the averaged scores and feedback similarity for each essay.

All CSV files meet the requirement of containing only raw CSV content with no additional formatting or explanations.
