      "content": "Saeng, a teenage girl, and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam. As Saeng walks home after failing her driver's test, she sees a familiar plant. Later, she goes to a florist shop to see if the plant can be purchased.\n\nIt was like walking into another world. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery. Huge flat leaves, delicate wisps of tendrils, ferns and fronds and vines of all shades and shapes grew in seemingly random profusion.\n\n'Over there, in the corner, the hibiscus. Is that what you mean?' The florist pointed at a leafy potted plant by the corner.\n\nThere, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single blood-red blossom, its five petals splayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.\n\n'Saebba,' Saeng whispered.\n\nA saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with vermilion flowers. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into the well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the bucket.\n\nSlowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus. Orchids, lanna bushes, oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her. Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world.\n\nWhen she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center—just as she had known it would feel.\n\nAnd beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers. 'Madagascar periwinkle,' its tag announced. How strange to see it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between tiled roofs.\n\nAnd that rich, sweet scent—that was familiar, too. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and found a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it. 'Dok Malik,' she said, savoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its tag, 'jasmine.'\n\nOne of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother's long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng would help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it.\n\nSaeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother?\n\nA wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her. A blink, a channel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone.\n\nAnd in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.\n\nIt was already dusk when Saeng reached home. The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk. As if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of the onions with a rusty trowel. She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to her.\n\nHer smile of welcome warmed Saeng. 'Ghup ma laio le? You're back?' she said cheerfully. 'Goodness, it's past five. What took you so long? How did it go? Did you—?' Then she noticed the potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind.\n\nMrs. Panouvong uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. 'Dok faeng-noi!' she said. 'Where did you get it?'\n\n'I bought it,' Saeng answered, dreading her mother's next question.\n\n'How much?'\n\nFor answer Saeng handed her mother some coins.\n\n'That's all?' Mrs. Panouvong said, appalled, 'Oh, but I forgot! You and the Lambert boy ate Bee-Maags . . . .'\n\n'No, we didn't, Mother,' Saeng said.\n\n'Then what else—?'\n\n'Nothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.'\n\nWhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.",
