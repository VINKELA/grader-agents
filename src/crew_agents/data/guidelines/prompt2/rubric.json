And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.\" --Katherine Paterson, Author\n\nWrite a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting your views on censorship in libraries. Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive?
