5986,3,"The essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” describes a man’s bicycle ride through California. Now, California is very hot during the summer, which is when the cyclist is riding. This setting greatly affects the man’s journey. It made it very difficult for him to finish his ride. He drank most of his water in the beginning of his ride so he gets very dehydrated. The text states, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” As you can see the setting makes this man’s bikeride very hard."
5987,3,"In the story, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” written by Joe Kurmaskie, represents how certain conditions can affect a cyclist. The cyclist was biking through the desert to reach Yosemite National Park, but on his journey he accoutered many tough conditions to make it difficult to get there. First of all, the desert was very hot which makes travel very difficult. For example the text states, “the sun was beginning to beat down.” @CAPS1 makes any task difficult because the sun drain’s a person’s energy. Secondly, the trip was very long so the cyclist had a hard time conserving water.

Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” represents how certain conditions of an environment can affect a cyclist.  "
5988,3,"The setting of the authors “ shortcut” effected his performance and strength tremendously . whether it was the hills, heat or barren landscape all three took their toll on Joe Kurmaskie. Not only that, but his lack of water depleted his energy as well.” Flat road was repalced by short rolling hills.” The hills were a tough thing to pass since Joe was being drained of energy. He overcame this exhaustion when a building came into views.” I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited with what I believed was my last burst of energy. I manouvered down the hill.” The authour overcame all the problems ne faced even though it was difficult. He seems to have written this piece to exaggrate how important it is to keep going when you want to give up. Winston churchill once said, “ success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage it takes to continues that counts.” I believe that @PERSON2 agrees."
